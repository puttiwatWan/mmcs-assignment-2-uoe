  !! ==================== Objective function ====================
  !! The objective function is to minimized the cost. The total cost can be calculated as:
  !! total_cost = cost for opening each cenralized facility +
  !!              cost for opening each localized facility +
  !!              cost for opening each refuelling station +
  !!              cost for producing each kg at centralized facilities +
  !!              cost for producing each kg at localized facilities +
  !!              cost for tubes transportation back and forth
  total_cost := sum(s in supply) (cen_fac_open(s) * CenOpenCost) +
                sum(c in customers, t in locFacType) (loc_fac_open_at(c,t) * LocOpenCost(t)) +
                sum(c in customers) (station_open(c) * CusOpenCost) +
                sum(c in customers, s in supply) (cen_prod(c,s) * CenProdCost) +
                sum(c in customers, t in locFacType) (loc_prod(c,t) * LocProdCost) +
                sum(c in customers, s in supply) (n_tubes(c,s) * DistCustomerSupply(c,s) * (2 - EmptyTubeCostReduction) * TubeTransCost)
  !! Noted that the (2 - EmptyTubeCostReduction) is for calculating back and forth. When delivery, the cost is just TubeTransCost.
  !! When coming back (with an empty tube), the cost is (1 - EmptyTubeCostReduction) * TubeTransCost. Therefore, combining both,
  !! TubeTransCost + (1 - EmptyTubeCostReduction) * TubeTransCost = (2 - EmptyTubeCostReduction) * TubeTransCost


  !! ==================== Constraints ====================
  !! Each of these variables should be binary
  forall(c in customers) station_open(c) is_binary
  forall(s in supply) cen_fac_open(s) is_binary
  forall(c1 in customers, c2 in customers) cover(c1,c2) is_binary
  forall(c in customers, t in locFacType) loc_fac_open_at(c,t) is_binary

  !! Number of tubes used needs to be an integer
  forall(c in customers, s in supply) n_tubes(c,s) is_integer

  !! Each refuelling station can be covered only once by a capable refuelling station.
  forall(c2 in customers) sum(c1 in customers) cover(c1,c2) * canCover(c1,c2) = 1

  !! Each station can be covered only by an open station
  forall(c1 in customers, c2 in customers) cover(c1,c2) <= station_open(c1)

  !! Any centralized facilities can be open or closed
  sum(s in supply) cen_fac_open(s) <= nbSupply

  !! Each opened refuelling station can only open either a large or small localized facility if needed.
  forall(c in customers) sum(t in locFacType) loc_fac_open_at(c,t) <= station_open(c)

  !! This is a production limit on how much each open centralized facility can produce.
  forall(s in supply) sum(c in customers) cen_prod(c,s) <= cen_fac_open(s) * CenProdLimit

  !! The number of tubes used for each station needs to be a total production in each centralized facility
  !! rounded up to the nearest multiple of TubeCap and then divided by the TubeCap.
  !! E.g. Let the TubeCap be 1000. If the demand is 4600, n_tubes should be 5.
  forall(c in customers, s in supply) n_tubes(c,s) * TubeCap >= cen_prod(c,s)

  !! The number of tubes used for each station cannot exceed the maximum limit.
  !! E.g. If MaxTubePerSite = 7, each station can only be delivered by no more than 7 tubes.
  forall(c in customers) sum(s in supply) n_tubes(c,s) <= MaxTubePerSite

  !! Each localized facility has a minimum and maximum production limit for each type.
  !! loc_fac_open_at is used to apply the constraint only if the localized facility is open
  !! at the refuelling station c.
  forall(c in customers, t in locFacType) do
    loc_prod(c,t) <= loc_fac_open_at(c,t) * LocProdLimit(t)
    loc_prod(c,t) >= loc_fac_open_at(c,t) * MinLocProd(t)
  end-do

  !! The total demand of each refuelling station (own demand + covered stations' demand) should not exceed the
  !! total amount of the production from both centralized and localized facilities that can be transported to
  !! that refuelling station.
  forall(c1 in customers)
    (sum(c2 in customers)(Demand(c2) * cover(c1,c2))) <= (sum(s in supply) cen_prod(c1,s)) + (sum(t in locFacType) loc_prod(c1, t))
